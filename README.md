# BuyableArchetypePowers

 Package file creates new versions of every archetype power and then adds shop listing for each of them so they will be permanent unlocks for the player when purchased.

- Cost 20 million each
- Requires Missionista 5 badge
- Can't buy archetype power for your current archetype (Can get duplicates if you obtain them with Galactic Adventures captain)
- Can only be purchased from T2 or T3 planets in your own Empire.

I still need to clean up the UI under the "My collections" section and in some other places.

Feel free to let me know if there should be any balance changes. If I feel they are appropriate I will change the main file, if you want to change them for yourself, you can unpack the package (or use the sourcecode directly) using any appropriate tool (Personally recommend SporeModderFX) and change the values in the files under the spacetrading section.
